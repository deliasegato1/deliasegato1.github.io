I'm a research fellow at CNR - Institute of Polar Sciences in Venice (Italy) and my research focuses on the biogeochemical cycles of bromine, mercury and iodine using ice core reconstructions. I recently obtained my PhD in Science and Management of Climate Change at Ca' Foscari university of Venice in Italy. My expertise covers several areas of climate science, including paleoclimate, polar climate, atmospheric dynamics and chemistry, ocean and sea ice dynamics. \\
For my future career I aim to focus on paleoclimate modeling.
