I'm a research fellow at CNR - Institute of Polar Sciences in Venice (Italy) and my research focuses on the biogeochemical cycles of bromine, mercury and iodine using ice core reconstructions. I recently obtained my PhD in Science and Management of Climate Change at Ca' Foscari university of Venice in Italy. My expertise covers several areas of climate science, including paleoclimate, polar climate, atmospheric dynamics and chemistry, ocean and sea ice dynamics. 
I aim looking for new research opportunities on the field of paleoclimate modeling using ice core records spanning the Last Glacial Period.


### Current project
* Analysis of mercury in the SE-Dome ice core (Greenland) using cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectroscopy

### Previous projects
* Reconstruction of mercury flux in the EGRIP ice core for the period 9000 - 15700 years before present. Find [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01172-9) the article.
* Reconstruction of halogens (bromine and iodine) in the EGRIP ice core over the last 15700 years.
* The spatial variability of halogens and methanesulphonic acid deposition in the Southern Ocean reconstructed using five sub-Antarctic shallow cores.
* Human impact on the fire regime
