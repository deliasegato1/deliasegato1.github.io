I'm a climate scientist at the European Commission's Joint Research Center in Ispra, Italy. My research focuses on improving the estimation of regional methane emissions, particularly from anthropogenic superemitters. Previously, my work centered on the biogeochemical cycles of bromine, mercury, and iodine using paleoclimate reconstructions and chemistry modeling.<br>
<br>

My primary research interest lies in **climate-chemistry feedback**—understanding how atmospheric composition impacts climate. I enjoy coding in Python and am developing expertise in numerical modeling, with aspirations to expand beyond WRF.<br>

### Previous Projects
- **Halogens and mercury analysis in the Southern Greenland**: Studied halogens and mercury in the SE-Dome ice core (Greenland) using ICP-MS and CV-AFS.
- **Mercury Flux Reconstruction**: Reconstructed mercury flux in the EGRIP ice core (9000-15700 years BP). [Read the article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01172-9).
- **Reconstruction of halogen biogeochemical cycles since the Last Glacial Termination**: Reconstructed bromine and iodine levels in the EGRIP ice core over the last 15700 years.
- **Estimation of spatial variability of halogens and methanesulphonic acid in the Southern Ocean**: Studied halogens and methanesulphonic acid deposition variability in the Southern Ocean using five sub-Antarctic shallow cores. [Read the article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231023007057).
- **Reconstruction of fire regime in the High North Atlantic**: Analyzed human and natural impacts on fire regimes over the last 5 millennia using ice core data from the RECAP project. [Read the article](https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1533-2021).

### Awards and Honors
